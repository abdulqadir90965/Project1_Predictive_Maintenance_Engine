# Project1_Predictive_Maintenance_Engine
 A large-scale manufacturing facility operates 500 critical robotic arms. Unplanned equipment failure results in downtime costing approximately $10,000 per hour. The objective is to construct a binary classification system that predicts equipment failure with a lead time of 24 hours based on streaming sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure.
